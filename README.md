# HostFunder

HostFunder is a web application for your GameServer Hosting. This application consits of users reading articles used to earn virtual currencies that will later be used to create & renew their Servers in your Hosting.

This requires Google Adsense or some other ad service.

This will only work with Pterodactyl Panel and is NOT a hosting software like Pterodactyl Panel, its a STANDALONE website.


This will be my 8th Web Application of this kind that I create, and the first one which will be public.
